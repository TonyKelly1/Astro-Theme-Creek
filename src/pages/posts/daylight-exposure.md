I noticed a strange, but welcome, boost in my motivation to get out running over the past week.

Nothing much has really changed in my routine - I'm still doing most of my running in the evenings after work and following the same running program.

But come 4pm each day I've been watching the clock, waiting for it to turn 5 to get out the door.

After scratching my head for a few days I finally put it down to daylight hours starting to stretch back out and a few days of decent sun (but still freezing cold!).

## Method to my madness

I tried to dig into the science a little to see if my notion stacked up.

I've been following Professor Andrew Huberman for a while on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab/?hl=en "Andrew Huberman on Instagram") who runs a [neuroscience lab](https://hubermanlab.com/ "Huberman Lab website") in Stanford.

If you're interested in learning more about how the brain works and how our behaviour can impact it, I'd highly recommend giving him a follow. 

Having worked in the science industry for a few years, I've organised webinars with researchers and investigators on topics from neuroscience to astronomy. Getting to sit in and listen to cutting edge science was a real privilege, although often I drifted between being totally fascinated to not really knowing what they were talking about.

It's really cool to see labs like the Huberman lab make content like this really accessible for the wider public and easy to follow along - like this explanation of whether we have a [Jennifer Anniston neuron](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFAkoAZnMLk/) or not...

Anyway, back to the topic in hand. 

The post below started to join the dots on why I think I rediscovered a motivation boost over the last few weeks, mostly by accident in my case rather than design.

## Sunrise, sunset

Let's start with sunrise.

My kitchen table faces a window where the sunrises. Sunrise for the past few weeks has been around breakfast time, so I've been getting a healthy dose of sunrise (if that's a thing) most mornings.

And, if you follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/therunningveggie/ "The Running Veggie on Instagram"), you'll know that I like nothing more than a cup of tea on the front step when the weather permits. Who knew there could be benefits to being a day dreamer?

I've braved the cold a few times over the last few weeks as it's been a bit of a dry spell. Adding everything up, I've caught the sunrise on most days for the past few weeks.

Then we've got the sunset.

While I do most of my spring & summer running in the mornings, autumn & winter running is usually resigned to the evenings. If you're going to be running in the dark anyway, I figure there's not much benefit in losing sleep in the mornings.

With a little stretch in the evenings and sunset now falling in around 6pm, I'm usually out on the roads when the light drops.

If we look back to Professor Huberman's post, getting eyes on the evening sunset has real benefits for sleep patterns and circadian health. What better way to catch the sunset than to actually be outside and taking in the sights and sounds as night falls in.

## Forming good habits

I can't scientifically prove that my sunrise and sunset habits are the source of my motivational benefits over the past few weeks. 

What I do know is that not much else has changed - diet, sleep, work/life balance have all remained relatively the same and, having ran for the last 251 days in a row, my running volume has been really consistent.

It's something I'm going to try and do a little more deliberately into spring and summer. I'll switch back to morning runs and aim to be out for the sunrise, then chill for a few minutes in the evening as the sun disappears.

Give it a whirl yourself. Even if you don't get a motivation boost, grabbing five or ten minutes at the start and end of your day for yourself is no bad thing. 

Worst thing that will happen is that you get to watch a few sunrises and sunsets.

Disclaimer - don't stare directly at the sun at sunrise or sunset please.

Spring is coming - stay positive.
