This will be a work-in-progress article for the next few weeks. At the time of writing I am in the process of running a test on Wynter and will provide updates here on how things go.

## What is Wynter?
Wynter is a B2B message testing platform, founded by Peep Laja. There are several ways to structure your message test on Wynter. The test I am running is a straightforward one:
- We have written content for and designed a new homepage
- We want to get our new messaging in front of our target audience before releasing it into the wild
- The feedback we get from the test will allow us to get a grasp on what resonates with our audience or what needs clarified further

## Pros of Wynter
Any time you can speak with, or get feedback from, your target audience should be considered a very worthwhile exercise.

In terms of setting the test up, the key benefits are:

### Saving time
Sourcing your own customers or prospects, getting approval from Sales to speak with them, facilitating the interview or feedback process, is a labor-intensive and time consuming process.

At the very best you're looking at least a few weeks to get everything lined up, possibly even a month or 2 depending on how helpful your Sales team are and how willing customers are to get involved. I speak from experience when I say it will always take longer than you think to get everyone on board.

Wynter provide you with an audience. You can target by job title and level of seniority, and the spread of job titles is quite impressive. Time saver number one - you don't need to worry about lining up customers or prospects.

Time saver number 2 is the process of gathering feedback. You can provide a link to, or upload a screenshot of, your new page and compile questions to ask your target audience. You will then receive feedback within 24 to 72 hours.

Getting feedback within a few days vs potentially a few months is a bit of a no brainer.

### Accessing a solution-unaware audience
As Wynter sources your audience from their own pool of reviewers, there's a high probability that at least some (if not the majority) of people in the audience will not have heard of your product or solution.

I feel that this group will provide more of an acid test regarding your messaging and whether it resonates with them. There is no internal bias or pre-conceived opinions that you may get from an audience that is exclusively made up of existing customers, especially if  they are cherry-picked because of good relations with Sales or Account Managers.

If someone encounters the brand, product and messaging for the first time, and their initial reaction is 'I have no idea what this thing does', I'd rather know that than not.

### Price
As I haven't completed my initial test I can't comment too much on the quality or return on investment just yet. However, a one-off test will typically cost between $900 - $1,500. The price reduces significantly if you sign up for ongoing testing credits.

If you're running message testing with existing customers you will typically end up incentivising them to do so. If you're compensating 10 to 15 reviewers at $50-100 per person, you won't be long racking up a similar cost overhead.

## Cons of Wynter
I will wait for the test to complete before commenting on any cons - the experience has been a positive one on the whole, so far.

## When to run message testing?
You don't need to run message testing on every page of your website. There's a few obvious starting points - your homepage and key product or solutions pages. 

Let your data guide you on this one. If you have pages on your site with conversion potential and good levels of traffic, they will typically be good candidates to run message testing on.

Like most things in marketing, this shouldn't be a one-and-done exercise either. Things change - the market you operate in, customer perceptions, new competitors enter the market, new categories and sub-categories appear, a global pandemic, or a recession. All of these things can have an impact on your business and what worked last month may not work now. 

## Conclusion
