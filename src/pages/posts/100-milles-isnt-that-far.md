Sometimes you just need to bite the bullet and jump.

I’ve been toying with the idea of entering an Ultra marathon race for over a year. I’d planned to run a 50 miler in 2021, but a few injuries and the arrival of baby Shea put those plans back a little.

When I caught a glimpse of the We Run Wild NI 100 mile Ultra Marathon along the Ulster Way, I knew it was the one.

What sealed the deal was that the route passes through Moydamlaght and Eagle’s Rock. A mountain about 5 miles from home that I spent many a weekend rambling around. It remains to be seen how fun a ramble around it will be after 70 miles or so on the road (and beach, cliff-tops, fields and trails).

## The plan

First thing was to find a 100 mile training plan.

It wasn’t as intense as I had imagined. Running five days a week with one long run during the week is pretty manageable coming off the back of my run every day for a year escapade. Some weekends will be heavy going; the latter half of the program has 30 mile runs on Saturday, followed by another 20 miles on Sunday.

If you haven’t worked it out by now, there are (and will continue to be) many ‘Fuck it, just do it’ moments. Think about things too much and your brain will become your worst enemy.

A funny side story to that. On our recent Sunday run we’d completed three loops of our mountain trail and were deliberating doing a fourth. As we reached the gate my running buddy Joe said, ‘Fuck it, just do it’. I knew I’d picked the right mantra and having someone running with you who thinks the same way is a huge help.

A 25 week training program means kicking off around mid-December with the race scheduled for early June. I’m aiming to get a 50 mile race in around February or March in 2022.

## Preparation

I’m realistic in that I know there is a high risk of failure in any ultra, never mind my first 100 miler. Getting to the start line injury free will be a feat in itself.

I think you just need to accept that as part of ultra running. Longer distance typically means more aches and pains. I’m not blessed with pace, so slowing things down and trying to preserve the legs for as long as possible will suit me.

Base building has already started and will continue for the next month or so. Starting to get into the rhythm of the training program; out 5 days a week with a few long runs in the mountains at the weekend.

## Sleep and diet

Being plant based already, my diet’s already in pretty good shape. Few things to iron out, but I won’t have to make any spectacular changes. Remove some junk and processed food and we’re good to go.

I'll be following the 28 day meal plan in The Plant-Based Diet Revolution by Dr Alan Desmond. If it works out, I'll do that on repeat throughout the program.

I’m going to hammer sleep hard through as much of the program as possible. For a few months in early 2021 I followed advice around sleep from the Huberman Lab podcast and my quality of sleep was incredible. Some of those good habits include:

- Getting outside for at least 10 minutes around sunrise (early morning runs really help with this)
- Getting outside at sunset
- Ceiling lights out after 8.30pm
- No screens or phones after 8.30pm
- No caffeine after 4pm
- Bed at 9.30pm
- Awake at 5.30am

If I can stick to that plan as much as possible (weekends included), I’ll be in a good place.

I’ll be back with another update around the start of the program. I can already feel the running obsession setting back in. It makes answering the 5.30am alarm clock that little bit easier.

Time to see how deep this rabbit hole goes. Fuck it, just do it.
