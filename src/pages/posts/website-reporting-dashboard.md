Running in the dark is quickly becoming my favourite time to get out on the roads. Let’s face it, living in the Irish countryside and working 9-5 means pickings are slim for daylight running during Autumn and Winter.

## Here’s a few tips for running in the dark that I’ve picked up over the last few years:

1. The most obvious – wear some form of bright and reflective clothing.
2. Get a good head torch – if you’re covering a longer distance consider getting 2 (or replacement batteries) encase you run out during your run. Quite affordable at around £30.
3. If you run listening to music turn your headphones down much lower than normal or, even better, don’t listen to music at all. A bit more awareness to what’s going on around you (cars, strangers, etc.) is always a good thing.
4. When approaching hills put all your focus on the brow of the hill – you’ll see headlights sooner and get plenty of time to get off the road so the car can pass.
5. Following on from the previous point, always get off the road as quickly as you can when you see a vehicle approaching – even if the road is quite wide, there’s no guarantee that motorists will always see you.
6. Run with someone else or in a small group if possible – and let someone know what time you’ll be back.
7. Know your route – if you’ve ran the route a few times in daylight you’d be surprised how quickly you can remember where the potholes and bad corners are.
8. Bring your phone – encase you get lost, followed or trip and fall.
9. Be aware of your surroundings – this ties in closely with not listening to music when running in the dark. You need to be aware of cars, wildlife, the terrain and other people – your senses are sharpened when running in the dark, use them to your advantage.
10. Have a plan for the worse case scenario – if you get chased by a dog or a stranger, what are you going to do?

## Life lessons from running in the dark

There is a much deeper connection with your environment when running in the dark. The first few runs can be a nervous experience, but once you’ve been out a few times it quickly becomes the new norm.

Your brain is not your friend when trying to convince yourself to go out for a run, and night time running makes those barriers seem a little bit tougher to get over.

Like most things in life, the person usually responsible for holding you back from trying new or difficult things is yourself.

I believe running is 75% a mental battle at the best of times, perhaps even more so when running in the dark – learning to acknowledge those doubts in your head and put them to one side makes them easier to deal with.

As with most running experiences the best way is usually to get stuck in, give it a try and embrace the challenges along the way.
